Important performance parameters:
LCP: Largest Contentful Paint (Loading performance); good >= 2.5sec, needs improvemnt 2.5sec > and > 4.0sec, poor <= 4.0sec
FID: First Input Delay (Interactivity); good >= 100ms, needs improvemnt 100ms > and > 300ms, poor <= 300ms
CLS: Cumulative Layout Shift (Visual Stability); good >= 0.1, needs improvemnt 0.1 > and > 0.25sec, poor <= 2.5sec

LCP; good >= 2.5sec, needs improvemnt 2.5sec > and > 4.0sec, poor <= 4.0sec
FID; good >= 100ms, needs improvemnt 100ms > and > 300ms, poor <= 300ms
CLS; good >= 0.1, needs improvemnt 0.1 > and > 0.25sec, poor <= 2.5sec

LCP; Check with the developers tab and inspect network waterfall to id potential bottlenecks
    Reduce the resource loadtime of the bottlenecks by:
        1. Compress images and use modern formats
        2. Only use the bare minimum fonts you need to load the website and use a CDN
        3. Render blocking js use server side frameworks like next.js instead of single page applications
        4. Use preload links in html and fetchpriority

FID; Use the web vitals plugin to inspect the reaction speed of interactions
    Increase the reaction speed of the user interactions
        1. Reduce js reaction time by moving your javascript into a worker with webworkers or partytown or use a lazy loader like reactlazy or frameworks like quick

CLS; Use lighthouse in chrome devtools or use the webvitals extions
    1. Dont use images without a width or height
    2. Use srcset to use images under different conditions (desktop, laptop, mobile)
    3. Do not show ads
    4. Do not poorly designed animations
 
Tools to use:
Web vitals chrome extensions
unlighthouse
